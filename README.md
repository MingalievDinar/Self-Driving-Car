# Self-Driving-Car

## Introduction
An autonomous car (self-driving car) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.
Autonomous cars combine a variety of techniques to perceive their surroundings, including radar, laser light, GPS, odometry and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage 
Self-driving cars are the future of smart transportation.

Despite it looks like too sophisticated to create your own car, actually it is not so hard as expected.
Here I would like to show my programming experience with Self-Driving-Cars during passing Udacity courses.
